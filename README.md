# Vivado_Automation_Script

In the new generation of chip design, where time is an important parameter, the complexity of designs grows exponentially. It is also noted that Verification is always considered the longest part and takes up about 70% of the life cycle of a chip design. Therefore, automatically doing a repetitive task is very important to improve productivity. This is where “scripting” skills are invaluable to any design or verification engineer.

Vivado synthesis flow is automated. Power, timing and LUT utilisation has been extracted.

In this repository:
Automation is the python script for the whole automation process.
tcl files are for running vivado.
Different .v files are also uploaded.
Results2.csv is final output.

The single zip (.tar) file contains all the automation files, verilog files, tcl files and results.

Vivado Synthesis flow has been automated.
Different power components has been evaluated like static power, DC power, Total Power.
For timing details: Datapath Delay is calculated.
In LUT utilisation: Diffent LUT utilisations are extracted.
